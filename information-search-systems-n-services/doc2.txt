One fateful day, as Max was trotting along his favorite trail by the river, he heard a faint whimpering sound coming from the bushes. 
Curiosity piqued, he darted toward the noise and discovered a tiny, shivering kitten trapped in the underbrush. 
Without hesitation, Max gently nudged the kitten with his nose, encouraging it to come out. 
The kitten, though frightened, sensed Max's kindness and cautiously emerged, with Max leading the way back to safety.
